  # Sending mail from a controller involves three steps:
  #
  # * Set mail settings in merb_init.rb (Not shown here...see the Mailer docs).
  # * Create a MailController subclass with actions and templates.
  # * Call the MailController from another Controller via the send_mail method.
  #
  # First, create a file in app/mailers that subclasses Merb::MailController. 
  # The actions in this controller will do nothing but render mail.
  #
  #   # app/mailers/article_mailer.rb
  #   class ArticleMailer < Merb::MailController
  # 
  #     def notify
  #       @user = params[:user]
  #       render_mail
  #     end
  # 
  #   end
  #
  # You also can access the params hash for values passed with the 
  # Controller.send_mail method. See also the documentation for 
  # render_mail to see all the ways it can be called.
  #
  # Create a template in a subdirectory of app/mailers/views that corresponds
  # to the controller and action name. Put plain text and ERB tags here:
  #
  #   # app/mailers/views/article_mailer/notify.text.erb
  #   Hey, <%= @user.name %>,
  #   
  #   We're running a sale on dog bones!
  #
  # Finally, call the Controller.send_mail method from a standard 
  # Merb controller.
  #
  #   class Articles < Application
  #
  #     def index
  #       @user = User.find_by_name('louie')
  #
  #       send_mail(ArticleMailer, :notify, {
  #         :from => "me@example.com",
  #         :to => "louie@example.com",
  #         :subject => "Sale on Dog Bones!"
  #       }, { :user => @user })
  #       render
  #     end
  #
  #   end  
  #
  # Note: If you don't pass a fourth argument to Controller.send_mail,
  # the controller's params will be sent to the MailController subclass
  # as params. However, you can explicitly send a hash of objects that 
  # will populate the params hash instead. In either case, you must 
  # set instance variables in the MailController's actions if you 
  # want to use them in the MailController's views.
  #
  # The MailController class is very powerful. You can:
  #
  # * Send multipart email with a single call to render_mail.
  # * Attach files.
  # * Render layouts and other templates.
  # * Use any template engine supported by Merb.

    # Allows you to render various types of things into the text and HTML parts
    # of an email If you include just text, the email will be sent as
    # plain-text. If you include HTML, the email will be sent as a multi-part
    # email.
    #
    # There are a lot of ways to use render_mail, but it works similarly to the
    # default Merb render method.
    #
    # First of all, you'll need to store email files in your
    # app/mailers/views directory. They should be under a directory that
    # matches the name of your mailer (e.g. TestMailer's views would be stored
    # under test_mailer).
    #
    # The files themselves should be named action_name.mime_type.extension. For
    # example, an erb template that should be the HTML part of the email, and
    # rendered from the "foo" action would be named foo.html.erb.
    #
    # The only mime-types currently supported are "html" and "text", which
    # correspond to text/html and text/plain respectively. All template systems
    # supported by your app are available to MailController, and the extensions
    # are the same as they are throughout the rest of Merb.
    #
    # render_mail can take any of the following option patterns:
    #
    #   render_mail
    #
    # will attempt to render the current action. If the current action is
    # "foo", this is identical to render_mail :foo.
    #
    #   render_mail :foo
    # 
    # checks for foo.html.ext and foo.text.ext and applies them as appropriate.
    #
    #   render_mail :action => {:html => :foo, :text => :bar}
    #
    # checks for foo.html.ext and bar.text.ext in the view directory of the
    # current controller and adds them to the mail object if found
    #
    #   render_mail :template => {:html => "foo/bar", :text => "foo/baz"}
    #
    # checks for bar.html.ext and baz.text.ext in the foo directory and adds
    # them to the mail object if found.
    #
    #   render_mail :html => :foo, :text => :bar
    #
    # the same as render_mail :action => {html => :foo, :text => :bar }
    #
    #   render_mail :html => "FOO", :text => "BAR"
    #
    # adds the text "FOO" as the html part of the email and the text "BAR" as
    # the text part of the email. The difference between the last two examples
    # is that symbols represent actions to render, while string represent the
    # literal text to render. Note that you can use regular render methods
    # instead of literal strings here, like:
    #
    #   render_mail :html => render(:action => :foo)
    #
    # but you're probably better off just using render_mail :action at that
    # point.
    #
    # You can also mix and match:
    #
    #   render_mail :action => {:html => :foo}, :text => "BAR"
    #
    # which would be identical to:
    #
    #   render_mail :html => :foo, :text => "BAR"
